[section:feat]Curse of the Lycanthrope[/section][section:trait]curse[/section][section:trait]necromancy[/section][section:trait]primal[/section]

[p]

This curse affects only humanoids. Saving Throws Fortitude DC based on your level minus 1 (see DCs by Level table).

[b]Critical Success[/b] You are not cursed.

[b]Success[/b] You are cursed, but it can be removed by the Remove Curse spell. If it is not removed before the next full moon, you instead count as having failed.

[b]Failure[/b] You are cursed. The Remove Curse spell allows the caster to take the Remove Lycanthropy action.

[b]Critical Failure[/b] You are cursed. Only Wolfsbane can remove the curse.

[b]Requirement[/b] You casted Remove Curse on a creature with the Curse of the Lycanthrope and are trained in Nature.

The curse is loosened by your spell, but still connected. Make a Nature check with a DC equal to the Saving Throw of the curse.

[b]Critical Success[/b] You remove the curse.

[b]Success[/b] The cursed creature can make a new Saving Throw, with a +2 circumstance bonus.

[b]Failure[/b] The curse is not removed. But you can choose to transfer the curse to yourself. If you do, you do not make a Saving Throw, instead you are treated as having a Critical Failure.

[b]Critical Failure[/b] The curse is not removed and you contract the Curse of the Lycanthrope (you can make a Saving Throw).
