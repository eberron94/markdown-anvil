A cleric and champion's relation to a church or organization is more important than their relation with a deity. This allows a cleric to be any alignment and replaces the Anathema feature with the following: 

[section:feat]Abhorrent[/section]

**Special** This replaces the Anathema feature for clerics, as well as any mention of Anathema for champions in the Deity and Cause feature.

Acts fundamentally opposed by your church's alignment or ideals are abhorrent to them. Learning or casting spells, committing acts, and using items that are abhorrent to them can remove you from their good graces, if they find out. But, if a cleric loses faith in their deity or a champion breaks their code, they can be subject to the original Anathema rules for losing abilities as the source of power is disrupted.

Violating the ideals and goals of the church might risk punishment, but a corrupt faction within it will hide the abhorrent actions. In the case of being caught, churches like the Silver Flame and the Sovereign Host will have a cleric perform a ceremonial version of the Atone ritual as a way to determine if the individual is penitent or not. Instead of losing or gaining divine abilities, the result is interpreted by a superior and only effects the political standing of the atoning individual.

Clerics may choose to devote themselves to one of the pantheons instead of a single deity. In this case, the cleric may choose any two domains from the deities in the pantheon. The domains can be from different deities.
