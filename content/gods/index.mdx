Although the gods may not walk among mortals in Eberron there is no shortage of faith. Some argue that it is because of this faith that clerics can cast their divine magic, not because of the gods themselves. Further support for this theory comes from clerics of cults or other non-divine lead religions such as the Lord of Blades who find themselves still able to perform the same abilities as those with more divine inspiration at their behest. Whatever supernatural power clerics tap into on Eberron there is no doubt of the force behind this power and its ability to shape Eberron.
