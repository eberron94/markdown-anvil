Eberron does not work well with the concrete concept of alignment as presented in Pathfinder 2e. This is best presented by Keith Baker in this [article](http://keith-baker.com/tag/alignment/). With that in mind, these rules are applied for the campaign .

**Changes**

-   Any alignment assigned by a player or present in a creatures stats is a personal alignment and has no mechanical affects.
-   A Cleric's or Champion's personal alignment does not need to match their deity or cause.
-   The alignment traits are removed from items and spells.
-   The alignment traits are removed from creatures.
-   Certain creature types gain alignment traits (celestial are good, undead are evil). A creature gains the alignment trait possessed by its creature type.
-   Certain groups of creatures gain alignment traits (demons are chaotic).
-   An alignment trait can be applied to an individual in special circumstances, like merging with a powerful angel of lies would add the chaotic trait.
-   Alignment traits are purely a function of the cosmology and do not affect personality or motivation.
-   Alignment spells are unchanged.
-   Alignment damage is unchanged.

**Creature Types**
