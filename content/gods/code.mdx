title: 'Champions and the Code'

The champion follows a code, which represents their faith and is the core of their divine power. If a champion knowingly breaks their code, or discovers that they broke it in the past, they lose their abilities as per the Champion's Code. They are still beholden to the ideals of their church.

The tenets a champion can select are less black and white in Eberron. While some were developed by a church, for example the Destruction of Evil was developed by the Silver Flame, a champion need not be part of a church to swear by a code of conduct.

The tenets found below can be taken instead of the ones found in the Core Rule Book, seen [here](https://2e.aonprd.com/Tenets.aspx). Swearing on the tenets of Good or Evil requires you to follow a Good or Evil god respectively.

[section:feat]Destruction of Evil[/section]

- I will destroy alien evil, such as fiends and aberrations, both malevolent and foreign.
- I will destroy unnatural evil, such as undead and lycanthropes, as they are corrupt.
- I will destroy innate evil, such as medusas, yuan-ti, and hads, as they conflict with the good.
- I will destroy those who choose evil, as they only spread more evil.
- I will destroy the evil within.

The tenant of destroy innate evil is the most contentious category on the list, and it is the idea of monstersâ€”that there are creatures native to Eberron who are evil by nature. In the past, the church has placed medusas, harpies, trolls, and similar creatures into this category, asserting that through no fault of their own, these creatures are vessels for supernatural evil and pose a threat to the innocent.

**Special** If you follow the Church of the Silver Flame, you must follow this tenet.
