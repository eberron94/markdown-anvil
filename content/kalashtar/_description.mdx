**Area** 30-foot emanation or more

**Duration** sustained up to 8 hours

You can telepathically communicate with willing creatures you can see within the emanation. Those creatures can respond telepathically with [section:one-action] [/section], which has the Concentrate and Mental traits.

This provides no special access to a target's mind, it can only communicate information as normal speech would.

**Heightened (+2)** The radius increases by 10 feet.
