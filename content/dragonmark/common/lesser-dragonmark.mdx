You have manifested a lesser Dragonmark giving you a stronger connection to the Draconic Prophecy. This power gives you Dragonmark spells, which are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparation, and can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to meditate on your dragonmark.

Your Dragonmark spells are arcane spells. When you first gain a Dragonmark spell, you become trained in arcane spell attacks and spell DCs. Your spellcasting ability is based on your Dragonmark.

Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. Focus spells don’t require spell slots, and you can’t cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.

The dragonmark spell you gain is based on your Dragonmark dedication. If you must choose a spell, you cannot change it later.
