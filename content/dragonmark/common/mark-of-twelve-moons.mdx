Your dragonmark has mysterious ties to one of Eberron's twelve moons. While your moon is full, you gain the benefits of the Wild Empathy ranger feat. Additionally, you can communicate with lycanthropes in hybrid and beast form with the feat.

If you are a lycanthrope, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to control your actions when your moon is full.
