You have manifested the least Mark of Making somewhere on your body.

You gain the Magical Crafting feat, even if you don't meet that feat's prerequisites. Choose one of the following: rune (object), rune (weapons), rune (armor), scroll, wand, staff, or talisman. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your Craft action when working on the chosen item. If you are a master in Crafting, this bonus increases to a +2. 

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Mark of Making archetype.
