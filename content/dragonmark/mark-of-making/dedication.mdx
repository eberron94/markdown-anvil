You have manifested the least Mark of Making somewhere on your body.

You gain the Detect Magic cantrip if you do not have access to it from some other source. You can Cast the Spell as an arcane innate spell at will. The cantrip is heightened to a spell level equal to half your level rounded up.

You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to your Seek action to discover hidden creatures or to discover objects (including secret doors and hazards).

Your Seek attempts to discover hidden creatures are made in a 60 ft. cone rather than a 30 ft. cone and your attempts to discover hidden objects are made in a 30 ft. cone rather than a 10 ft. square adjacent to you.

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Mark of Making archetype.
