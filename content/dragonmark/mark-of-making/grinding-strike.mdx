You know just where to strike a construct to take it down. Your weapons and unarmed attacks gain the deadly d6 weapon trait when you attack a construct. If the weapon or unarmed attack already has the deadly trait, increase the size of the deadly damage die by one step instead of giving it deadly d6.

If you possess the Greater Dragonmark, the deadly trait increases to a d8. With the Grand Dragonmark feat, the deadly trait increases to a d10.
