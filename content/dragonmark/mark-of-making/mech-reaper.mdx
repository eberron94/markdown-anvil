Your skill and fervor allow you to pierce construct defenses and exploit their weaknesses. When you make an attack using a weapon or unarmed attack with which you have master proficiency and hit a construct creature, you ignore 5 points of the creature's resistances, and the construct's weaknesses are 2 higher against your attack.
