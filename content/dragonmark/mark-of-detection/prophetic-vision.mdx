As you undertake your training as a Medani prophet, you begin to receive powerful visions of the past and future. These rare and cryptic revelations are a tool for the GM to advance the story, and the frequency and nature of these visions is determined by the needs of the campaign. These visions often connect to your current location, such that you are far more likely to see an image of the ancient battles between quori and giant if you are in Xen'drik.

If a vision strikes while you are awake, you must make a Saving Throw Will DC 15 or be stunned 4 as the images wash over you.
