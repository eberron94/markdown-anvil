When you cast Augury as a dragonmark spell, you channel your divine training into the prediction.

Augury provides a useful piece of advice to a question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity that is to occur within 1 week. The advice granted by the spell can be as simple as a short phrase, or it might take the form of a cryptic rhyme or omen. If you donâ€™t act on the information, the conditions may change so that the information is no longer useful. The base chance for a correct divination is 70% + 1% per level, to a maximum of 90%. If the die roll fails, you know the spell failed, unless specific magic yielding false information is at work.
