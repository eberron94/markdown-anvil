You spend 10 minutes in deep meditation. You expend one focus point to peer into the past. You can three questions regarding the past of the area you are in. You receive your answers as a combination of indistinct sensory impressions, as determined by the GM. For example, if you ask "Who killed Borestes?" you might learn that it was a male half-orc wielding an axe, but you will not learn the name of the killer. If you happen to be familiar with this particular half-orc, you might instinctively recognize him. In general, however, the imagery is vague and blurred; however, you might catch a particularly vivid image, such as a precise look at the killerâ€™s distinctive axe.

The answers you receive come not from any deity, but from your dragonmark's supernatural connection to the past. As such, treat the answers as coming from an effectively omniscient being. However, you will only receive responses to questions regarding events that occurred within your line of sight, and any magical effect that would have interfered with scrying automatically conceals past events from this power. For example, you might ask a question regarding a crime committed at a particular site, but if the character who committed that crime was under the effect of Nondetection at the time, the response will be completely indecipherable. This ability works best when you ask specific questions: The move vague the question you ask, the more vague the response will be.

The maximum period you can look back through time is based on the strength of the dragonmark whose power you expend.
