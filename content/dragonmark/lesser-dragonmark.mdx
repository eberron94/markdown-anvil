Your dragonmark can be used to cast special spells related to its power.

Dragonmark spells are a type of focus spell. It costs 1 Focus Point to cast a focus spell and you start with a focus pool of 1 Focus Point. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparation, and can regain 1 Focus Point by spending 10 minutes using the Refocus activity to meditate on your dragonmark.

Focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up, much like cantrips. Focus spells don’t require spell slots, and you can’t cast them using spell slots. Taking feats can give you more focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 Focus Points.

The dragonmark spell you gain is based on your Dragonmark dedication. If you must choose a spell, you cannot change it later.
