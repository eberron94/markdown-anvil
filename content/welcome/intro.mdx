title: Welcome to Eberron

_A large amount of the introduction to Eberron pages are taken from Reddit user u/cassie-lyn. They wrote an amazing document that has been paraphrased and recompiled for this site._

Welcome to Eberron: known for its fantasy tone with pulp and dark elements mixed with a technology like trains, skyships, and mechanical beings.

The parts are roughly ordered in importance, so if want the basics read the rest of this page and take a look at the Eberron Cheat Sheet.

## The Tone

The Eberron setting can be used to tell swashbuckling pulp stories or noir intrigue as well as a magic world spanning adventure.

Magic is common, and weaved through everyday life. Blacksmiths use Mending for minor repairs, Continual Flame lamps light the streets, and travel between cities is accomplished with the lightning rail.

The world is made of shades of gray. Both heroes and villains come in all races, classes, shapes and sizes. It’s just as likely that the innkeeping gnome next door is an evil assassin and the tribal orc in the swamp is a holy druidic guardian. A metallic dragon is just as likely as a red one to fall under evil’s influence and a coven of hags brings more stability to a region, instead of chaos. Not even religion is black and white: the gods don’t manifest physically, and wielding divine magic to keep evil at bay requires faith in the unseen.

## The Last Century of War

The last century was defined by a civil war that ravaged the continent, that ended only 2 years prior to the start of the campaign.The war began with the children of King Jarot all vying for the crown and only ended after the signing of the Treaty of Thronehold. The nation of Galifar split into five: Aundair, Breland, Cyre, Karrnath, and Thrane.

Many atrocities were committed by all sides. The singular event that lead to the end was the Day of Mourning, which saw the complete destruction of Cyre in an instant.

With the end of the war coming from an unclaimed cataclysm, the peace the remaining nations find themselves is tenuous. A belief in mutually assured destruction keeps the peaces but trust between the survivors is weak.
