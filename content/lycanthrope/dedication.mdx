You have learned to live with your curse and have gained some measure of control over it.

You can use the Change Shape action.

Once you have 4 Lycanthrope archetype class feats, you no longer need to fight the cursed beast for control. You gain the following:

-   The Curse of the Lycanthrope cannot be removed and loses the curse trait.
-   You gain darkvision in your Humanoid Form, Hybrid Form, and Beast Form.
-   You age at half your original rate.
-   Increase your Hit Points by your level.
-   Moon Frenzy no longer gives you the controlled condition.
-   Change Shape can be used an unlimited number of times each day and has no duration.
-   Your Hybrid Form is your natural form, when you fall unconscious you return your Hybrid Form.
-   Creatures damaged by your jaw Strike or that ingest your blood are inflicted with the Curse of the Lycanthrope.
-   You gain resistance to physical damage (except silver and adamantine) equal to your number of Lycanthrope archetype feats you have.
