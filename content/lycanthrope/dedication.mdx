You have been cursed with Lycanthropy. You gain the werecreature trait.

**Silver Weakness** You gain weakness silver 5.

**Animal Empathy** A werecreature can communicate with animals of the same general kind.

**Senses** You gain low-light vision and scent (imprecise) 30 feet.

**Moon Frenzy** When a full moon appears in the night sky, you must enter hybrid form and cannot Change Shape thereafter. The hybrid form gains the following abilities: you become one size larger, increase your reach by 5 feet, and increase the damage of your Jaw by 2. When the moon sets or the sun rises, you return to your humanoid form and are fatigued for 2d4 hours.

**Special** Unlike a normal dedication feat, this one is automatically gained as a bonus feat during your first full moon after you become cursed with Lycanthropy. You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Lycanthrope archetype. Once you have two feats, you gain True Lycanthrope as a bonus feat. If you already have a dedication feat that prevents you from selecting other dedication feats, you are unable to select feats for that original dedication until you fulfill this one.
