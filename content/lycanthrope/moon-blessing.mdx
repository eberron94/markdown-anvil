When you enter hybrid form or beast form from your human form, you gain a number of temporary Hit Points equal to your level plus your Constitution modifier. When you change to your humanoid form, you lose any remaining Hit Points from Moon's Blessing and you cannot gain temporary Hit Points from this feat for 1 minute.
