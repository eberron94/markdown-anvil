**Frequency** Once before returning to Humanoid Form.

You purge the planar energies into a beam of energy that manifests as a 30-foot line, dealing damage determined by the plane. Each creature in the area must attempt a basic saving throw against the higher of your class DC or spell DC.

At 9th level and every 3 levels thereafter, the damage increases by one die. The shape of the breath, the damage type, and the saving throw match those of your draconic exemplar (see Table 1â€“1). This ability has the trait associated with the type of damage it deals.
