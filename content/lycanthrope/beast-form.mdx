You add the following to Change Shape. 

Changing into your Beast Form unleashes the primal nature of your cursed beast, transforming your physical form into your cursed beast. You return to your humanoid form after 10 minutes or when you fall unconscious. You can extend the duration as a free action by expending one use of Change Shape. While in this form:

-   Your alignment becomes Chaotic Evil.
-   You gain the beast trait.
-   You gain weakness silver 10. This replaces your humanoid form weakness silver. When you take damage with the silver trait, it ignores any temporary Hit Points you have.
-   You can't speak, but can communicate with animals similar to your cursed beast.
-   You can't use actions with the concentrate trait unless they also have the rage trait. You can Seek while in Hybrid Form.
-   Apply all Beast Form changes listed in your cursed beast.
