You have been inflicted with the Curse of the Lycanthrope that only affects humanoids. An ancient, powerful, and animalistic spirit resides in you, called your cursed beast. This spirit causes you to transform on nights of the full moon and takes control of your body. As a result of the curse, you gain the following for your humanoid form:

**Werecreature** You gain the werecreature trait.

**Unarmed Strike** You gain a melee fist Strike that deals bludgeoning damage equal to the damage dealt by your Claw (or the lowest damage die of your Hybrid Forms unarmed attacks).

**Silver Weakness** You gain weakness silver 5.

**Animal Empathy** You can communicate with animals of the same general kind as your cursed beast.

**Senses** You gain the senses low-light vision and scent (imprecise) 10 feet.

**Moon Frenzy** When a full moon appears in the night sky, you use your next three actions to transform into your cursed beast's Hybrid Form until the moon sets or the sun rises (you cannot use the Change Shape action). The Hybrid Form also includes the following: you gain the controlled condition from the cursed beast, you become one size larger, increase your reach by 5 feet, and increase the damage of your Jaw by 2. When the moon sets or the sun rises, you return to your humanoid form and are fatigued for 2d4 hours.

The curse is usual spread by being bitten by a a true werewolf or by ingesting their blood. When you first become cursed, you can make a Saving Throws Fortitude DC based on the level of the inflicting creature minus 1 (see DCs by Level table).

**Critical Success** You are not cursed.

**Success** You are cursed, but it can be removed by the Remove Curse spell. If it is not removed before the next full moon, you instead count as having failed.

**Failure** You are cursed. The Remove Curse spell allows the caster to take the Remove Lycanthropy action.

**Critical Failure** You are cursed. Only Wolfsbane can remove the curse.
