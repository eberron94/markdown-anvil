Natural obstacles pose no obstacle to you in your way. You gain the ranger's Wild Stride class feature. This allows you to ignore the effects of all non-magical difficult terrain, treat greater difficult terrain as merely difficult terrain, and gives you an additional benefit from Favored Terrain based on the terrain.
