You change into your Humanoid Form or Hybrid Form. Each form has a specific, persistent appearance.

Changing into your Humanoid Form returns you to your original state. When you use Change Shape to leave Hybrid Form or Beast Form early, it counts as one of your limited uses of the action.

Changing into your Hybrid Form unleashes your wild nature, transforming your physical form into a hybrid of humanoid and your cursed beast. You return to your humanoid form after 10 minutes or when you fall unconscious. You can extend the duration by 10 minutes as a free action by expending one use of Change Shape. While in this form:

-   Your alignment becomes Chaotic Evil.
-   You gain the beast trait.
-   You gain weakness silver 10. This replaces your humanoid form weakness silver. When you take damage with the silver trait, it ignores any temporary Hit Points you have.
-   You can't speak, but can communicate with animals similar to your cursed beast.
-   You can't use actions with the concentrate trait unless they also have the rage trait. You can Seek while in Hybrid Form.
-   Apply all Hybrid Form changes listed in your cursed beast.
-   Apply all feats with the Hybrid Form trait
