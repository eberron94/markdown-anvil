When a full moon appears in the night sky that is not your primary moon, you must make Saving Throws Fortitude with a DC based on your level minus 2 (see DCs by Level table).

**Critical Success** You resist the Lesser Moon Frenzy for the night.

**Success** As Critical Success, but you make a new Saving Throw in an hour.

**Failure** As Critical Failure, but you make a new Saving Throw in a minute.

**Critical Failure** You use your next three actions to transform into your cursed beast's Hybrid Form until the moon sets, the sun rises, or until you make a new Saving Throw and succeed (you cannot use the Change Shape action). The Hybrid Form also includes the following: you gain the controlled condition from the cursed beast and increase the damage of your Jaw by 2. When the moon sets or the sun rises, you return to your humanoid form and are fatigued for 2d4 hours. You make a new Saving Throw in an hour.
