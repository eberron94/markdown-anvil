The curse is loosened by your spell, but still connected. Make a Nature check with a DC equal to the Saving Throw of the curse.

**Critical Success** You remove the curse.

**Success** The cursed creature can make a new Saving Throw, with a +2 circumstance bonus.

**Failure** The curse is not removed. But you can choose to transfer the curse to yourself. If you do, you do not make a Saving Throw, instead you are treated as having a Critical Failure.

**Critical Failure** The curse is not removed and you contract the Curse of the Lycanthrope (you can make a Saving Throw).
