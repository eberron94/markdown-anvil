Small dragonshards are embedded in the lining of this leather bag, which is designed to enhance the power of the Mark of Hospitality. 

When you replicate Create Food with a dragonmark spell, you reduce the casting time to 1 minute. You can choose to add a material component to the spell of edible ingredients to produce food that is not the usual bland fare created by the spell; instead, you can make a Lore (Cooking) or Crafting check to determine the nature and quality of the food.

The DC is usually 15, though the GM might adjust it based on the circumstances, such as creating a cake outside in a storm, or using mysterious ingredients found in a dungeon. If youâ€™re an expert in the used skill, you can instead attempt a DC 20 check to increase the quality; if you're a master, you can instead attempt a DC 30 check to increase the quality even more; and if you're legendary, you can instead attempt a DC 40 check to maximize the quality.

**Critical Success** The food is delicious, and those who partake in the meal can barely stand when it is over.

**Success** The food has flavor and a pleasant full feeling lingers with those who eat it.

**Failure** The food is bland and unappealing, but it is nourishing.

**Critical Failure** As failure, but the food only lasts 1 hour before it decays and becomes inedible.

**Craft Requirements** Creator must have the lesser dragonmark and Mark of Hospitality traits.
