Modeled after the reins a mundane coach driver uses to control the horses pulling the coach, these long leather cords are affixed at the helm of a Lightning Rail. While holding the reins, you can communicate with the elemental telepathically, without a shared language. The Drive, Run Over, Stop, and Take Control actions do not have the linguistic trait. When you are in exploration mode, you can pilot the vehicle without meeting the skill requirement.
