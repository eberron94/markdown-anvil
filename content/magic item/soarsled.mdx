A {title} is a crystalline disk crackling with energy, 5 feet in diameter, that flies with greet speed and maneuverability through the air in Sharn's manifest zone. It can carry only so much, taking a â€“10-foot penalty to its Speed if laden with more than 20 Bulk, and crashing to the ground if it carries more than 30 Bulk.

**Activate** {one-action} envision, Interact; **Requirements** You are standing on the {title}, within Sharn's manifest zone; **Frequency** once per round; **Effect** You give a mental command to the {title} and it grants you a fly Speed of 45 feet until the end of your turn. You must activate the {title} each round to hover, but you do not need to take the Fly action to hover.

If you plan to move more than 10 feet as part of the Fly action, you must make a DC 15 Acrobatics Check to maintain your balance. Moving more than 30 makes the DC 25. The GM can adjust the DC based on weather. Any effect that modifies the Balance action will affect this check.

**Success** You move without issue.

**Failure** You move, but you are flat-footed until the start of your next turn.

**Critical Failure** The {title} slips out from under you and you fall.
