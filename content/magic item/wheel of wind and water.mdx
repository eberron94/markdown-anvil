This ornately carved wooden wheel resembles the helm of a mundane sailing ship, but it is mounted at the helm of an Elemental Galleon or an Airship. While holding the wheel, you can communicate with the elemental telepathically, without a shared language. The Drive, Run Over, Stop, and Take Control actions do not have the linguistic trait. When you are in exploration mode, you can pilot the vehicle without meeting the skill requirement.
