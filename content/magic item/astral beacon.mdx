Tied to the Mark of Passage, this object acts as a magical beacon to Orien heirs slipping through the Astral Plane. An astral beacon is an 8-inch sphere formed from silver and crystal, with the dragonshard at the core; it is often encased in lead or embedded in the floor of a chamber to prevent enemies from stealing or smashing the sphere.

When you replicate Dimension Door or Teleport with a dragonmark spell, the range is doubled if the destination point is within 10 feet of an astral beacon. In addition, a location within 10 feet of an astral beacon is always treated as very familiar when casting a dragonmark spell with the teleportation trait.
