The following swashbuckler styles have been modified to use the new Gibe action.

## Gladiator (Battledancer)

To you, a fight is a kind of performance art, and you command your foes' attention with mesmerizing and distracting motions. You are trained in Performance and gain the Fascinating Performance skill feat. You gain panache during an encounter when the result of your Performance check to Gibe or Perform exceeds the Will DC of an observing foe, even if the foe isn't fascinated or taunted by the performance.

## Braggart

You gain the Hurtful Words skill feat. You gain panache during an encounter whenever you successfully Demoralize or Gibe a foe. You can use your proficiency with Intimidation instead of Performance for skill feats that modify Gibe.
