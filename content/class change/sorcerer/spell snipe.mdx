You laydown a thread of energy for your spell to follow. Choose a creature you can see and roll a d20. If your next action is to Cast a Spell without a duration that requires an attack roll against a single target, you must target the chosen creature and use the result of the roll you made to {title} for your spell's attack roll instead of rolling. You make this substitution only for the next spell you cast against the creature this round, not any subsequent spells.
