You closely follow your target's movement and estimate the perfect angle for your shot. Your next Strike with an alchemical bomb or blowgun may add your Intelligence modifier to your attack roll instead of your Dexterity modifier. If the target did not use an action with the move trait during its last turn, you also gain a +1 circumstance bonus.
