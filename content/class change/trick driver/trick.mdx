You attempt to convince a bound elemental used for elemental propulsion that you possess a true dragonmark. You must know what elemental is bound and which dragonmark it requires, or you can't attempt to trick it.

Attempt a check using Arcana against the Diplomacy or Intimidate DC. The GM may adjust the DC based on the situation or the elemental's memories.

**Critical Success** For the next 10 minutes, you can pilot the vehicle with whichever skill the vehicle can use. The DC increase from any Dragonmark Control is reduced by your level, to a minimum of 0.

**Success** As Critical Success, but DC is reduced by half your level.

**Failure** You do not convince the elemental and are unable to pilot the vehicle, but you can try again on subsequent turns.

**Critical Failure** The elemental is on to you, you can't try to trick it again until for 24 hours and you are not able to pilot the vehicle in any way.
