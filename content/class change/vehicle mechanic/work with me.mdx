An elemental bound to a vehicle only wants to express its nature, and can only do that while it is operational. During your time maintaining the vehicle, the elemental comes to understand that you are the one who keeps it operating. While you are aboard your signature vehicle, it does not apply the -2 penalty when the pilot attempts a piloting check for a reckless action.
