Through more discussion with the elemental, you let it know that if it does not play nicely with a pilot that does not have the right Dragonmark, it does not get to express itself. Your signature vehicle reduces the DC increase from lacking the correct dragonmark by half your level, to a minimum of 0.

**Special** If the pilot also has the Trick Elemental, the DC is reduced by both feats.
