Built as mindless machines to fight in the Last War, the warforged developed sentience as a side effect of the arcane experiments that sought to make them the ultimate weapons of destruction. With each successive model that emerged from the creation forges of House Cannith, the warforged evolved until they became a new kind of creatureâ€”living constructs.

### Automatons in Eberron
The [Automatons](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=48) from *Guns and Gears* can be found in Eberron as a warforged created before the Last War with an ancient schema. They have been alive for likely thousands of years, but were in stasis on Xen'Drik.
