You are skilled at finding constructs' weak points due to your understanding of your own construction. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to damage with weapons and unarmed attacks against constructs. If your attack would deal more than one weapon die of damage (as is common at higher levels than 1st), the bonus is equal to the number of weapon dice or unarmed attack dice.

In addition, if a creature critically succeeds at an attack against you and deals damage to you, you gain your bonus to damage against that creature for 1 minute regardless of whether it has the chosen trait.
