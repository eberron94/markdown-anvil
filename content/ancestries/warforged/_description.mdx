Built as mindless machines to fight in the Last War, the warforged developed sentience as a side effect of the arcane experiments that sought to make them the ultimate weapons of destruction. With each successive model that emerged from the creation forges of House Cannith, the warforged evolved until they became a new kind of creatureâ€”living constructs.

### Composite Frame

The plating used to protect your wooden skeleton is a special type of armor, designed to be integrated directly with a warforged's frame. You can only wear armor with the Component trait, this prevents you from wearing traditional armor. This armor is not natural armor so runes can be engraved on the armor. While you live, the armor incorporated into your body can't be removed against your will. If you are forced into a suit of armor, you do not benefit from the AC Bonus but the Dex Cap, Check Penalty, and Speed Penalty are still applied.

### Artificial Body
You are alive, but your physiological needs are different than those of living creatures. You don't need to eat or drink. You don't need to sleep, but you still need a daily period of rest. During this period of rest, you must enter a recuperating standby state for 2 hours, which is similar to sleeping except you are aware of your surroundings and don't take penalties for being unconscious. Much like with sleeping, if you go too long without entering your standby state, you become fatigued and can't recover until you enter standby for 2 hours.

## Heritages
You select a heritage at 1st level to reflect abilities passed down to you from your ancestors or common among those of your ancestry in the environment where you were born or grew up. You have only one heritage and can't change it later. A heritage is not the same as a culture or ethnicity, though some cultures or ethnicities might have more or fewer members from a particular heritage.

### Psi-forged
Your body was constructed with psychic crystals, synchronizing your mental energies. When Casting a Spell that requires material components, you can provide these material components without a material component pouch by drawing intricate replacement sigils in the air. Unlike when providing somatic components, you still must have a hand completely free. This doesn't remove the need for any materials listed in the spell's cost entry.

### Juggernaut
You were designed to be larger and sturdier than other warforged. You gain 12 Hit Points from your ancestry instead of 8. Increase your maximum and encumbered Bulk limits by 1.

### Scout
You were designed to be more nimble. Your Speed is 30 feet instead of 25 feet. When you take the Scout action, you can move at full speed instead of half speed.

### Utility
You were designed to work in non-combat situations. You are trained in one skill of your choice, and learn two languages of your choice.
