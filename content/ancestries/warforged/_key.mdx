You will see the following key terms associated with warforged features.

**Attachment** These equipment are attached to the wielder's body, typically a warforged. The process of attaching one of these weapons takes time similar to donning and removing armor. Attaching and removing one of these weapons are both activities involving many Interact actions. It takes 1 minute to attach or remove a weapon. Creatures take a -2 circumstance penalty to Athletics checks to Disarm an attached weapon. Arm attachments take up the use of your hand until removed.

**Component Plate** These unique sets of armor are designed to be integrated with a warforged's skeletal frame. The process of integrating these armor sets takes as long as as donning and removing heavy armor, no matter the type of armor the item actual is.

**Retractable** The weapon is usually attached to a device, and can be retracted into the device, or be extended for fighting. You can extend or retract the weapon as an action.

**Living Construct** You don't have the typical construct immunities, can be affected by effects that target a living creature, and can recover Hit Points normally via positive energy. Additionally, you are not destroyed when reduced to 0 Hit Points. Instead, your life energy attempts to keep you active even in dire straits; you are knocked out and begin dying when reduced to 0 Hit Points. When a creature would attempt a Treat Wounds action on you, they must attempt a Craft check instead of a Medicine check, and must use their Craft skill proficiency to determine the check DC and amount of Hit Points healed.
