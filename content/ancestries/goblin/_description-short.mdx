The goblinoids are more than tribes of savages scratching at the edges of civilization. They carved out a nation in Khorvaire during the Last War and ruled an empire that spanned the continent. Cunning, fierce, and strong in number, goblinoids are poised to take back the empire that civil war destroyed millennia agoâ€”if they can manage to keep civil war from tearing apart their newborn nation.

### Heritages

You select a heritage at 1st level to reflect abilities passed down to you from your ancestors or common among those of your ancestry in the environment where you were born or grew up. You have only one heritage and can't change it later. A heritage is not the same as a culture or ethnicity, though some cultures or ethnicities might have more or fewer members from a particular heritage.
