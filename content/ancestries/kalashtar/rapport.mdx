During your daily preparation, you and your close allies can form a psychic rapport. When you cast Mind Link, you do not need to be able to see a creature you have rapport with and the range for that creature increases to 1 mile. At 9th level, the rapport range increases to 10 miles. At 13th level, as long as you are on the same plane as a creature you have rapport with, you can target them.

**Special** Normally, you can only form a psychic rapport with other player characters. A Game Master may allow NPCs to be included in special circumstances.
