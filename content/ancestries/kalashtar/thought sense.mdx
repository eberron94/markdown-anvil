You have learned to sense the surface thoughts of nearby creatures. You gain thoughtsense 30 as an imprecise sense.

Thoughtsense enables you to detect the thoughts of sentient creatures. As with your hearing and other imprecise senses, you still need to Seek to locate an undetected creature. Because thoughtsense detects a creatures thoughts, it can't detect mindless creatures or other creatures immune to mental effects. Unlike most senses, it can penetrate solid objects, but you take a -4 circumstance penalty to Perception checks made to Seek creatures through solid objects using thoughtsense.
