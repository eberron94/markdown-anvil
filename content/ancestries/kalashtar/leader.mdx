The Kalaraq are the natural leaders of the Quori and can guide their followers to stand resolute. When you sustain Mind Link, choose one target to gain a +1 circumstance bonus to AC and saving throws until the start of your next turn.

If you do not need to sustain Mind Link, you instead choose a creature to benefit as a free action on your turn.
