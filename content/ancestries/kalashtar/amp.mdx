You have learned how to amplify your psychic cantrips. Amps are specific thoughtforms that alter the nature of psychic cantrips. When you cast a psychic cantrip, you can amp it by spending 1 Focus Point to add the effect described in the spell's Amp heading. You choose which amp to use, if any, each time you cast a psychic cantrip.

If you don't already have one, you gain a focus pool of 1 Focus Point, which you can regain using the Refocus activity to meditate; if you already have a focus pool, increase the number of Focus Points in your focus pool by 1. Rather than spending Focus Points to cast focus spells, you spend them only on amps. (Though if you have focus spells from a source other than psychic, you can still spend Focus Points to cast them, as normal.)
