**Cast** {three-action} emotion

**Range** 30 foot; **Targets** You and 1 other creature

**Duration** sustained up to 1 hours

You link your mind with a creature you can see, allowing two-way communication with a creature while they are in range. This link lasts for up to 1 hour if you choose to sustain the effect, or until the target is outside the range. You can communicate basic ideas telepathically with creatures using shared mental imagery even if you don't share a language. You may only have one active {title} in this way at a time.

Communicating through the link is a free action with the concentrate and mental traits. All targets receive the same communication, no side conversation. This provides no special access to a target's mind, it can only communicate information as normal speech would.

**Special** If all targets know the quor language, information and ideas can be conveyed ten times faster.
