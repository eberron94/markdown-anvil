You possess a natural talent with your latent telepathic abilities. With training you have learned not just to project your thoughts effortlessly, but control the flow of information. The duration of Mind Link increases to 8 hours and you can block specific creatures from receiving or transmitting information through the connection (effectively splitting the communication into groups).
