**Range** 60 foot; **Target** 1 creature

**Saving Throw** Will; **Duration** 1 round

You overwhelm a foe with shadows and whispers drawn from the realm of dreams. The dread deals mental damage equal to your spellcasting ability modifier; the target must attempt a basic Will save. If the target critically fails the save, it is also frightened 1.

**Heightened (+2)** The damage increases by 1d6.

**Amp** The fear created by this spell cracks the target's mental defenses, leaving them susceptible to further psychic attack. If the target fails its Will save, it gains weakness 1 to mental damage until the end of your next turn and takes a â€“1 status penalty to Will saves until the end of your next turn. On a critical failure, the weakness is 3, and the target is also stunned 1. The weakness applies before daze deals damage

**Amp Heightened (+2)** The weakness on a failure or critical failure increases by 1.
