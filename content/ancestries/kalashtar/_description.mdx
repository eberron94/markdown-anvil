The kalashtar are a compound race: incorporeal entities from the alien plane of Dal Quor, the Region of Dreams, merged with human bodies and spirits to form a distinct species. They were once a minority among the quori, the native race of Dal Quor, hunted and persecuted for their religious beliefs. Thousands of years after the quori invaded Eberron and the connection between their plane and the Material Plane was severed, the kalashtar were the first of the quori to discover a means to reach the Material Plane once more. Fleeing persecution, they transformed their physical forms into psychic projections that allowed them to enter the Material Plane and possess willing humans. Today, new kalashtar are born, not possessed; neither spirit nor human, they are a new race that breeds true.

### You Might... 

-   Aim to understand the emotions of those around you, even if the situation doesn't call for it.

-   Very rarely consider the limitations you may encounter as you draw up your goals and aspirations.

-   Believe that the rules of reality can be bent like those in dreams.

### Others Probably... 

-   Think you're human, though you move and act in a slightly otherworldly way.

-   Find themselves drawn to the wisdom you display, which seems beyond your years.

-   Opening their emotions to you, even before they realize they are doing so.

### Physical Description

Kalashtar appear human, but their spiritual connection affects them in a variety of ways. Kalashtar have symmetrical, slightly angular features, and their eyes often glow when they are focused or expressing strong emotions. Beyond this, most creatures struggle to tell Kalshtar and Humans apart at a glance.

### Society

Kalashtar are born diplomats and relate fairly well to individuals of all races—except, of course, the Inspired. They relate best to humans, with whom they share the greatest physical similarity, but some kalashtar find themselves strongly drawn to other races instead. They oppose the Inspired in all ways, both within Riedra and beyond its borders, and likewise oppose any group or force that corrupts or degrades mortal souls.

### Religion

Kalashtar do not follow gods, but they have their own religion, called the Path of Light. The center of this belief system is a universal force of positive energy the kalashtar call il-Yannah, or "the Great Light." Through meditation and communion with this force, the kalashtar seek to strengthen their bodies and minds for the struggle against the forces of darkness that threaten all life on Eberron. Though il-Yannah is not a deity, its few clerics draw power from the Path of Light. A greater number of devout followers of the Path are psions and psychic warriors.

### Adventures

Every kalashtar enters adulthood facing a fundamental choice: Try to live a normal life as a persecuted exile in Adar, or take up a more active role in combating the Inspired in the world. Not surprisingly, many kalashtar choose the latter option and live a life at least bordering on that of the adventurer. Most kalashtar adventurers are motivated primarily by their hatred of the Inspired, but a few — primarily those advanced along the Path of Light — are driven by their compassion for all living beings and their desire to fight darkness in whatever form it takes.
