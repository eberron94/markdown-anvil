You will see the following key terms in many kalashtar features.

**Amp** Amps are special thoughtforms that modify the properties of your psychic cantrips. You can apply an amp only to a psychic cantrip, which is referred to as the amped cantrip. Applying an amp to a psychic cantrip costs 1 Focus Point and is part of the actions needed to Cast the Spell. The singular focus required to amp a psychic cantrip means that unless otherwise noted, you can apply only one amp to a given psychic cantrip, and you can't apply both an amp and a metamagic ability to a cantrip at the same time. If both an amp and the amped cantrip deal damage of the same type, combine their damage for the purpose of resistances and weaknesses. Feats with the amp trait provide different amps you can apply to psychic cantrips in place of their normal amps.

**Emotion Components** An emotion component adds the concentrate trait to your action to Cast a Spell. You might summon the sense of freedom to buoy you through the air or let fear grip your heart even as you plant it in another's mind. Emotion components tend to impart abstract or vivid effects to your visual and auditory spell manifestations as well as more intangible flashes of emotion, such as swirls of joyous color or a sense of growing melancholy.

If you're affected by a harmful emotion effect, the discordant emotions sap some of your concentration, causing your cantrips (including psychic cantrips) to heighten to a level 1 lower than normal (or to their minimum level, if it's higher). For instance, if you were 5th level, a Link Minks cantrip you cast would be 2nd level instead of 3rd level.
