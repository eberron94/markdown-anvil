You select a heritage at 1st level to reflect abilities passed down to you from your ancestors or common among those of your ancestry in the environment where you were born or grew up. You have only one heritage and can't change it later. A heritage is not the same as a culture or ethnicity, though some cultures or ethnicities might have more or fewer members from a particular heritage.

### Changeling Traveler
You're an urban nomad, wandering from city to city. You become trained in the Society Skill (or another skill if you were already trained in Society) and gain the Streetwise skill feat. You have experience fitting into the local culture and blending with the common folk, so you're easily able to get a feel for the pulse of the local settlement. You may use the Streetwise feat in any settlement in which you have spent at least a day.

### Hidden Changeling
While changelings are common in major cities, there are many villages and towns where changelings are treated with fear and suspicion. You might have been born into such a community, possibly never even knowing another changeling. As a hidden changeling, you have crafted a single identity that you consider to be your true face. You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Impersonate checks to pretend you are of the ancestry which you were raised as. In addition, you gain the adopted ancestry feat for that ancestry.

While you gain a circumstance bonus to pretend you are of an ancestry, this does not apply to deception checks you make while you are that ancestry. For instance, a human guard might be unable to see that you are not human and are a shapeshifted changeling, but might still be able to see that you are not the guard you are pretending to be.

### Persona Changeling
You have developed multiple personas that have developed as entirely separate lives - and are connected to the network of changeling personas across Khorvaire. You gain the Different Worlds feat. In addition, when you approach a new community you may already be aware of local changeling personas that you can use. At the GM's discretion, make a DC 15 flat check. If you succeed, you may interact with this settlement as if you had a second identity from the Different Worlds feat, but without the benefit of the lore skill. You could have already established a persona as a priest who will receive sustenance at the local temple, a folk hero who will be sheltered by the common people, or a veteran soldier who can always get a bed at the local garrison. Once this check has been made against a settlement, you may not make it again for another month.

### Watchful Changeling
You're experienced with the deceptions of shapeshifters, given that you specialize in it. You are trained in the Deception skill (or another skill if you were already trained in Deception), and gain the Lie To Me skill feat. In addition, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to detect polymorphed creatures.
