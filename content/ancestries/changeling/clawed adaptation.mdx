When you Shift shape, you can add claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a different natural weapon of your choice to your form. While adding this quality to a form, you change your unarmed strikes but these changes are obvious to observers. Your unarmed strikes deal 1d4 piercing or slashing damage, as appropriate to the natural weapon you chose. These attacks are in the brawling weapon group and gain the agile, finesse, and unarmed traits.
