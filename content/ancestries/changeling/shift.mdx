**Cast** {three-action} somatic

**Duration** until the next time you cast this spell or die

You can change your appearance and your voice. You determine the specifics of the changes, including your coloration, hair length, and sex. You can also adjust your height and weight, but not so much that your size changes. You can make yourself appear as a member of another ancestry, although your game statistics do not change. You cannot duplicate the appearance of a creature you have never seen, and you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs that you have. However, your clothing and equipment are unchanged by this spell.

Shift shape counts as setting up a disguise for the Impersonate use of Deception; it ignores any circumstance penalties you might take for disguising yourself as a dissimilar creature, it gives you a +4 status bonus to Deception checks to prevent others from seeing that you are a shapeshifted changeling, and you add your level even if you're untrained. You can Dismiss this spell.
