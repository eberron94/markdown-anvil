Performing for others has always been second nature to you. You gain the Virtuosic Performer skill feat. If the performance you pick is visual, you can augment your performance with a use of shift shape to take on a visually appealing form. If you do so, the circumstance bonus is +2 whether or not you are a master in performance.
