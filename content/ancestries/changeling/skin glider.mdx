**Trigger** You begin to fall more than 30 feet

When you begin to fall, you're able to shift your shape to maximize your air resistance, not unlike a flying squirrel. Your fall slows to 60 feet per round. This rapid change is extremely obvious to any observers watching, and all of them become aware that you are a changeling.

**Special** If you have the Rapid Shift feat, the trigger is instead when you begin to fall more than 5 feet.
