You have a way of communicating that leaves others hanging on your words. You become trained in Diplomacy (or another skill if you are already trained in Diplomacy). You may pick Bargain Hunter, Group Impression, or Hobnobber. If you get a critical failure when using the skill feat you picked, it is a failure instead.
