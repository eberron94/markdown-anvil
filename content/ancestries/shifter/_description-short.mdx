Shifters, sometimes called "the weretouched," are descended from humans and natural lycanthropes, now nearly extinct on Khorvaire. Shifters cannot fully change shape but can take on animalistic featuresâ€”a state they call shifting. Shifters have evolved into a unique race that breeds true. They have a distinct culture with its own traditions and identity.

Beasthide (Bear, Boar); Longtooth (Tiger, Wolf); Swiftstride (Tiger, Rat, Leopard); Wildhunt (Wolf, Rat, Tiger); Cliffwalk (Monkey); Razorclaw (Leopard, Tiger).
