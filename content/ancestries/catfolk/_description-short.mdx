Curious and gregarious wanderers, catfolk combine features of felines and humanoids in both appearance and temperament. They enjoy learning new things, collecting new tales and trinkets, and ensuring their loved ones are safe and happy. Catfolk view themselves as chosen guardians of natural places in the world and are often recklessly brave, even in the face of overwhelming opposition.

In Eberron, the catfolk can be found in the Lhazaar Principalities or Xen'Drik. While many see them as shifters, they are in fact a distinct race. Those found in the Lhazaar Principalities are either traders or pirates, while the ones in Xen'Drik live nocturnally in the desert on the north-west part of the continent or in the jungle.
