**Optional Rule** [Free Archetype](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1333) 

At 2nd level and every even level thereafter, you gain an extra class feat that can only be used for an archetype dedication or an archetype feat. Only archetypes on the approved list can be used for this extra feat. Any ancestry feat that grants you an archetype dedication adds that archetype to the list.

Your normal class feats can still be used to take archetype feats for any archetype, including ones on this list.
