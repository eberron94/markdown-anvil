With a vicious insult or a provoking display you draw the ire of a creature. Choose a creature within 30 feet of you who you're aware of. Attempt a Performance check against that target's Will DC. If the target does not understand the language you are speaking, or you're not speaking a language, you take a â€“4 circumstance penalty to the check. Regardless of your result, the target is temporarily immune to your attempts to Gibe it for 10 minutes.

As long as you are not threatened by other hostile creatures, if you make yourself flat-footed to attacks from that creature until the start of your next turn you get a +4 circumstance bonus to the check.

The GM should encourage their players to come up with fitting insults. A deeply personal or culturally intolerable provocation may apply a -1 or -2 status penalty to the target's Will DC, or affect the behavior of the target beyond the effect of the taunted condition.

**Critical Success** The target becomes taunted 3.

**Success** The target becomes taunted 2.

**Critical Failure** The target reads your feeble attempt to affect its decision in combat and becomes temporarily immune to any of your attempts to Gibe it for 1 day.
