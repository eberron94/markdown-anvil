A new condition has been added.

## Taunted

You've been challenged or insulted during combat in a way that might influence you into attacking the creature that dared to draw your ire.

The taunted condition always includes a value and a target creature. You take a status penalty equal to this value to your attack rolls against creatures other than the target.

While taunted, other attempts to taunt you automatically fail. If you become frightened while taunted, you lose the taunted condition and become temporarily immune to this condition until you lose the frightened condition.

Unless specified otherwise, at the end of each of your turns, the value of your taunted condition decreases by 1.
