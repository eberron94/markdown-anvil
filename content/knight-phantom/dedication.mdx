A Knight Phantom is a specialized cavalry unit developed by Aundair during the Last War. These units excelled at reaching strategic locations quickly through the use of a phantom steed. The training involved in becoming a Knight Phantom is guarded by the Knights Arcane.

You gain the Ride general feat, enabling you to command your mount with ease.

You can use the Conjure a Phantom Mount action.

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Knight Phantom archetype.

**Frequency** Once every hour.

You cast the Phantom Steed spell, ignoring the usual casting time. The tradition of this action matches the tradition that allows you to cast Phantom Steed, if you have multiple choose one. You can only have one Phantom Steed with this action at a time, using this action again before the spell ends causes the first Phantom Steed to disappear.
