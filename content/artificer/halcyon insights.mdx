Your study of primal practices and the effect of Eberron dragonshards on its magic allows you to emulate them through artifice.

You can add primal spells to your codex as you would arcane spells. In addition when you craft primal magic items, you ignore any requirements related to class, alignment, or belief system.

When you would roll Nature to identify magic item's or Trick a Magic Item, you can choose to roll Arcana instead.
