Artificers devote their life to tinkering with the forces of magic, bending them to their will will nails and gears.

You gain the Trick Magic Item skill feat. You also gain the No Need for Tricks activity.

Additionally, you gain a codex, a special type of spellbook, that contains two 1st-level arcane spells. When you are crafting a magic item that requires you to supply a casting of an arcane spell whos level is no greater than half your level, you fulfil that requirement if the spell is in your codex. A codex can be used as a spellbook when preparing and casting spells. You can add arcane spells to your codex by Learn a Spell.

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Artificer archetype.
