You have a small supply of special Eberron dragonshards that are capable changing their properties. Each day during your daily preparations, you can create a single temporary wand containing a 1st-level spell. The spell must be one in your codex. This wand is an unstable, temporary item and loses its magic the next time you make your daily preparations. It can't be used to Learn the Spell.

At 6th level, you can create a second wand which contains a 2nd level spell. At 8th level, you can create a third wand which contains a 3rd level spell.

Additionally, when you use wands and scrolls that you have tricked, you are considered trained for spell attack rolls and spell DCs, using your Intelligence modifier, with the spells it casts.
