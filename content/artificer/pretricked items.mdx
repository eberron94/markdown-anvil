During your daily preparations, choose one or more items with a cumulative level no greater than your own --- e.g. at level 4, you can choose two 2nd level items or one 4th level item. These items are considered tricked as per Trick Magic Item while you are invested in them until your next daily preparations. If the item cannot normally be invested, it can be until your next daily preparations.
