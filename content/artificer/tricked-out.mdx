- **Bolster** | **Effect** You gain temporary hit points equal to the item's level until the end of your next turn.
- **Fleet** | **Effect** You gain a +5 status bonus to your Speed until the end of your next turn. If the item's level is 6 or higher, you instead gain a +10 status bonus.
- **Blister** | **Requirement** The item's effect deals damage to a target; **Effect** One target of the effect takes additional damage equal to half of the item's level, minimum 1.
- **Reach** | **Requirement** The item casts a spell with a range of touch or greater; **Effect** You extend the range of the spell by 30 feet.
