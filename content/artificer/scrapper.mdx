You break down a magical item, extracting the arcane substance that powers it, Eberric dust. You spend 4 days tearing apart the item, which yields an amount of Eberric dust equal to 3/4 the magic item's gold value rounded down. Each 100 gp of Eberric dust weights one L bulk.

Eberric dust's properties are not well known by those untrained in the art of artifice and is unlikely to be found in the open market. When you craft a magic item, you can use Eberric dust as half of the raw material's gp value. For example, an item with a base cost of 200 gp in raw material can be crafted with 100 gp worth of Eberric dust while the remaining 100 gold of raw material is supplied by normal means.
