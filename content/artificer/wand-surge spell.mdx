You infuse the wand with extra power from an Eberron dragonshard. If you next action is to Cast a Spell from a wand, you overcharge the wand but reduce the DC of the flat check to DC 5. If the wand has already been overcharged today, you instead supercharge the wand. You cast the spell again, then roll a DC 19 flat check.

**Success** The wand is broken

**Failure** The wand is destroyed

**Critical Failure** The wand explodes with a powerful force. The wand deals 2d10 force damage in a 10-foot burst centered on you, with a basic Reflex Save. Your result cannot exceed Failure. For every level of the wand beyond 1, the damage increases by 2d10.
