You interact to retrieve a wand, scroll, or magic item that requires activation and then use Trick Magic Item or No Need for Tricks on it.

If you can use the retrieved item without tricking it --- e.g. it is already tricked or naturally does not require tricking --- you can use this action as a free action.
