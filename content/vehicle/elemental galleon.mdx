The standard airship (at least as far as standards have developed for this relatively new creation) looks similar to an oceangoing ship, but is replete with control fins and rudders rather than sails. A Huge elemental is bound into a ring around the hull, suspended on four struts jutting outward. Many airships were built for the very wealthy and have been outfitted with the finest amenities, with many decorative flourishes included in their construction.
