The standard airship (at least as far as standards have developed for this relatively new creation) looks similar to an oceangoing ship, but is replete with control fins and rudders rather than sails. A Huge elemental is bound into a ring around the hull, suspended on four struts jutting outward. Many airships were built for the very wealthy and have been outfitted with the finest amenities, with many decorative flourishes included in their construction.

**Moving on Rails** This vehicle is held aloft by conductor stones which it must stay near. It can only travel forward or backwards along the line of conductor stones, called a rail. When a rail curves, the {title} must be moving under a certain speed or it will derail. When it derails, the vehicle and all its passengers takes the collision damage, no save. The derailment speed is determined by the number of cars, their load, and the angle of the turn. Most maps produced by House Orien will list the maximum safe speed at each curved section.

**Dragonmark Control** The power of the Mark of Passage gives its bearer control over elemental land vehicles. A pilot without the mark increases the piloting DC by 20 and can only use Diplomacy or Intimidate (DC 56).
