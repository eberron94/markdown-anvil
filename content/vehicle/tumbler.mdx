A tumbler is an odd vehicle. It looks like a large sphere of rough-hewn rock, with a seam that breaks a surface covered in dull stony spines. When a tumbler is open to accept or debark passengers, one can see seats within for up to twelve human-sized or smaller creatures.

The tumbler rolls when in motion across the ground, but a magic stabilization device built into the vessel keeps its occupants level as it goes. In addition, a ring of clear crystal windows are set into the sides of the sphere, fixed according to the perspective of the passengers. These windows prevent disorientation, allows the pilot of the vessel to see out, and lets passengers know where they are.
