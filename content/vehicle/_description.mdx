Some homebrew rules on vehicles and a list of Eberron vehicles. See the original rules [here](https://2e.aonprd.com/Rules.aspx?ID=1278).

# Homebrew: Movement in Exploration Mode

When using a vehicle in exploration mode, the vehicle's Speed is doubled before determining its travel speed. In order to pilot in exploration mode, your piloting skill must be greater than the piloting DC minus 20. If you meet the criteria, no Drive actions or piloting checks are necessary to pilot a vehicle at these speeds.

# Elemental Propulsion

Eberron vehicles can have elemental propulsion. By binding an elemental to a khyber dragonshard, a vehicle can be propelled by the elemental's desire to express its nature, be that burning, moving, blowing, or splashing. The bound creature's nature must be tempered by the pilot to keep control of the craft. Elemental vehicles can be piloted using the Diplomacy or Intimidation skill.

**Magical Controls** The Mark of Passage and Mark of Storm have a unique connection to certain elemental propulsion designs. Without it, it becomes incredible difficult to convince the vehicle to move, as the elemental wont listen to your commands. A pilot without the appropriate dragonmark increases the pilot DC by 20, can only use Diplomacy or Intimidate for piloting checks, and the Drive, Run Over, Stop, and Take Control actions gain the linguistic trait, as you need to command the elemental in kythric.

**Banishing** An elemental propulsion system can be targeted by banishment, the Will save is made using vehicle's Fortitude. On a failure, the vehicle is unable to move for one round and its's speed is halved for 1 minute. On a critical failure, the elemental is banished and the vehicle is destroyed. A pilot with the appropriate dragonmark can use their Will instead.

**Reckless Piloting** The bound elemental is always trying to push itself, outputting more elemental energy than the vehicle can manage. When attempting a piloting check for a reckless action, a pilot suffers a -2 circumstance penalty.

**Uncontrolled Vehicles** If the bound elemental is ever left to its own devices, it will push the craft beyond its limits. Each round it moves in a straight line 10 feet further than the previous round, up to three times its Speed. If it moves more than its Speed, it takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage and moving faster than twice its Speed deals 3d6, this damage ignores its Hardness.
