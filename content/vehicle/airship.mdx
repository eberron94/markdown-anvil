The standard airship (at least as far as standards have developed for this relatively new creation) looks similar to an oceangoing ship, but is replete with control fins and rudders rather than sails. A Huge elemental is bound into a ring around the hull, suspended on four struts jutting outward. Many airships were built for the very wealthy and have been outfitted with the finest amenities, with many decorative flourishes included in their construction.

**Speed** fly 50 feet (elemental, fire)

**Collision** 9d10 (DC 30)

**Sluggish** This vehicle must move twice its length for each 90-degree turn it makes.

**Suppression** While the elemental bound to the airship is crucial for propulsion, the vessel's soarwood hull provides its lighter-than-air buoyancy. With the elemental suppressed, the ship remains aloft but can only move 1 mile per hour. The pilot always suppresses the elemental before docking.

**Dragonmark Control** The power of the Mark of Storm gives its bearer control over elemental air vehicles. A pilot without the mark increases the piloting DC by 20 and can only use Diplomacy or Intimidate (DC 52).

**Craft Requirements** Requires binding a huge fire elemental and an air elemental to a khyber dragonshard; vessel constructed from soarwood.
