An earth sled looks like a small barge, approximately 30 feet long and 15 feet wide at its center. A short railing surrounds the open front of the vessel, and a small enclosure in the back provides some shelter from the elements. A podium at the fore of the craft sports two handles, which the driver uses to communicate with the elemental bound into the vessel.

Though an earth sled can carry up to twenty Medium creatures, most are outfitted to carry eight to ten creatures, with the rest of the space devoted to cargo. It has a total capacity of 5,600 pounds including passengers and cargo.

**Earth Skate** The elemental moves through the very ground beneath the sled, carrying it a foot or two above the surface. In motion, the earth sled appears to float along the ground, only a slight furrow marking its passage. An earth sled can traverse shallow water and bogs up to 4 feet deep with ease. Deeper water can also be navigated, though passengers and cargo run the risk of becoming wet. In theory, so long as the driver could somehow breathe, an earth sled could continue to skim along the bottom of a river, lake, or even the ocean. The earth sled can also climb up natural sheer surfaces, but not worked stone walls or similar construction.

**Mark of Passage** The elemental is easily controlled by the Mark of Passage.
