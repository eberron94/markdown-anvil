**Parent Language** None

**Script** Eberric

Kythric is a blue language written in Eberric script. The language is a key piece in the gnomes mastery of elemental binding. It is unknown when or where the gnomes learned Kythric, and Zilargo is reluctant to allow any outsider to learn it. Only those who receive special permission from the Triumvirate are allowed access to the tutors and secret libraries that hold the Kythric language.
