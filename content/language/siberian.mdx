Siberian is a blue language written in Siberian script. The translation of Siberian to other languages was originally managed by the dragons, but in the modern age they have little contact with Khorvaire. As a result, most translations found today come Mercantin d'Sivis's communication with the kobolds and dragonborns on Khorvaire.
