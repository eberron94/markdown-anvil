**Parent Language** Eladrin

**Script** Adren

**Frequently Used By** ancient gnomes, Zilargo academics

Arden is a descendant language of Eladrin, formed by the first gnomes to migrate to Khorvaire. It is written in its own script, which is used by Zilsh and Karrnon. The leading Linguistic theory is that since the migrated gnomes no longer lived in feyspires, they were no longer connected to Thelanis and its language. Shortly after the gnomes of the Sivis clan began manifesting the Mark of Scribing, they evolved the language into what is now known as a Zilsh, incorporating the linguistic magic from the mark.
