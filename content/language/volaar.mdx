**Script** Volaar

Volaar is a green language used by early goblins and the Dhakaani empire. It was thought to be a dead language, since the language evolved into Daglen after the Dhakaani empire fell, but the recent opened vaults of the Heirs of Dhakaan proved otherwise. These goblin clans that isolated themselves in deep underground vaults with the intention to protect the legacy of the empire should it fall.
