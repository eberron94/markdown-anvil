**Parent Language** None

**Script** None

Quori is a blue language with no known written or verbal components, instead it can only be used for telepathic communication. Coming from the natives of the plane of Dal Quor, Quor can only be "spoken" by Quori and the entities they have merged with, known as the Inspired and Kalashtar. Quor is significant in that it is the most efficient language, capable of sharing novels worth of information in a matter of seconds. 

**Special** While on the astral plane, any verbal trait can replace the emotional trait, which allows you to cast without speaking.

**Emotional** An emotional component is a clear focus on mental constructs or emotional states. You must hold them clearly in your head, so you must not be subject to an effect with the emotion trait. The spell gains the concentrate trait.
