**Parent Language** Brakia, Eladrin

**Script** Aeren

**Frequently Used By** citizens of Aerenal, elves from Aerenal

Aeren is the hybrid language of Brakia and Eladrin, which uses its own script. It formed when the giants enslaved the Eladrin of the feyspire known as Shae Tirias Tolai. These Eladrin became the first elves and, like the gnomes that migrated to the material plane, developed their own language. Most of the language comes from Eladrin, but the enslavement by the giants did change it over time.
