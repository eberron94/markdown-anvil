The languages found in Eberron are different from those described in the Core Rulebook. This list is not exhaustive, so additional languages could appear over the course of the campaign, but it gives a base line for what you as a player can start with or might experience.

Each language entry will list a script and parent language, when appropriate. This information is useful in determining the difficulty of translation and learning a new language. Additionally, languages have additional traits.

**Blue** Original languages that sprung into existence as a result of the planes or magic. Blue languages do not have dialects and do not change without external influence. For example, the Eladrin language only evolved into Adren after the gnomes left the plane of Thelanis. Many magicians learn their first few spells by speaking the verbal components in a blue language due to its strong connection with magic.

**Green** Original languages created by the first cultures of the material plane, like early humans and dwarves. These languages have no special power, but are of great interest for linguists.

At the start of the game, your language, background, and history will grant you a number of languages. Since the game is starting in Sharn, everyone knows Karrnon.

[h2]Translating Written Words[/h2]

You can use the Decipher Writing activity to translate a writing from one language to another. If you understand both the source and target language, it takes one minute per page. Knowing the one but not the other (e.g. knowing the target but not the source), it takes you 10 minutes per page but requires a glyph book and a Society check. The DC is determined by the GM based on the state or complexity of the document as well as the quality of your glyph book.

If the unknown language is the parent or child of a language you know, you gain a +2 circumstance bonus to the check. If you are a master in Society, the bonus is doubled.

Some languages do not have a written form, which prevents you from writing them unless you have the [Phonetic Training](https://2e.aonprd.com/Feats.aspx?ID=1995) feat.
