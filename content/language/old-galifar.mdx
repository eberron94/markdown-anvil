Old Galifar is a nickname for the five regional dialects found in pre-Galifar nation-states: Thalian, Wroash, Metrian, Korthan, and Dakarn. While these dialects did not diverge from each other much in the thousand years before Karrnon was made the official language of the Five Nations, they all separated greatly from the original Riedran. The pilgrimage through Lhazaar and finally settling in Khoarvaire changed the language enough that Old Galifar cannot be understood by a Riedran speaker.
