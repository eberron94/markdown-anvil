**Parent Language** Old Galifar, Aeren

**Script** Reidran

After House Phiarlan escaped Aerenal, the Aeren lanuage was allowed to change. This lead to the long lived elves communicating with the humans, and translating their old stories into Old Galifar. In less than a generation, the newly arrived elves had created their own language from the pieces of those they feared and their new human allies. The largest change was to their script, adopting Reidran, which was used by Old Galifar. Historians have named this modern Aereni language, Phiran, after House Phiarlan, but most elves still think of it as Aeren.
