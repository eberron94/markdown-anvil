The common tongue of the modern five nations, named after Karrn the Conqueror. The language was formed by House Sivis under contract with the Kingdom of Galifar as part of the King's economic development plan in 5 YK. House Sivis used the regional languages from the ancient Five Nations -- Thalian, Wroash, Metrian, Korthan, and Dakarn -- to form Karrnon. The contract also required House Sivis to provide, free of charge, a number of phonic books to all settlements in the kingdom every 10 years. In the first year of the Last War, this contract was broken. While House Sivis still maintain ownership of the language, a fact they do not let many forget, they no longer provide learning material to any of the nations for free.
