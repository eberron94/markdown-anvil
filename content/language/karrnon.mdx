**Parent Language** Zilsh, Old Galifar

**Script** Adren

**Frequently Used By** denizens of Khorvaire

The common tongue of the modern five nations, named after Karrn the Conqueror. The language was developed by House Sivis under contract with the Kingdom of Galifar as part of the King's economic development plan in 5 YK. House Sivis used the regional languages from the ancient Five Nations -- Thalian, Wroash, Metrian, Korthan, and Dakarn, which are collectively know as Old Galifar -- to form Karrnon. House Sivis also took it upon themselves to add grace and consistency, so they incorporated many of the rules from Zilsh. The contract also required House Sivis to provide, free of charge, a number of phonic books to all settlements in the kingdom every 10 years. In the first year of the Last War, this contract was broken since none of the Five Nations chose to up-hold it. While House Sivis still maintains ownership of the language, a fact they do not let many forget, they no longer provide learning material to any of the nations for free.
