**Parent Language** Adren

**Script** Adren

The language formed by a young House Sivis, Zilsh helped to unify the gnomes into the nation of Zilargo. Zilsh used the script of Adren, but its form was more functional for the magic that came with the Mark of Scribing. As House Sivis grew its bureaucracy, the language lost its informal articles and conjugations and became more strict with its grammar.
