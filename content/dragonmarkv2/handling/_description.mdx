The Mark of Handling grants powers related to the care and control of animals. The humans of House Vadalis carry the Mark of Handling. Their Handlers Guild controls the business of breeding and selling livestock throughout Khorvaire. Though the elves of Valenar are gaining a reputation for breeding the finest horses in Khorvaire, their steeds are rare and expensive, while House Vadalis provides a strong, loyal, and affordable mount.
