**Cast** {two-action} See replicated spell; dragonmark (lesser), somatic

**Frequency** You can only cast this spell once per daily preparation - even if you have the focus points to cast it.

With a concentrated effort to bend the powers of your mark, you replicate the effects of a spell.

When you begin to cast {title}, you choose to replicate [Friendfetch](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=860), [Pet Cache](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=706), [Animal Messenger](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=11), or [Speak with Animals](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=293). {title} gains the traits of the selected spell, then you may replicate the spell's effect by completing the Cast a Spell activity using the normal number of actions. The replicated spell is automatically heightened to the level of {title}.

You ignore any trivial material or verbal components of the replicated spell, but if the replicated spell requires a focus or material cost, you must still provide it to cast it.
