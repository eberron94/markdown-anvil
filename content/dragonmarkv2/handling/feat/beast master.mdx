A Vadalis beastkeeper is a master of magebred animals and magical beasts. Whether you aid the druids of the house in corralling livestock for magical enhancement, scour the wild for owlbear eggs, or guide a House Orien convoy through unexplored lands, your abilities and your magical companion or mount are well suited to the task. You gain the 2nd-level Beastmaster dedication feat, even if you normally couldn't take another dedication feat until you take more feats from your current archetype. You don't need to meet the feat's ability score prerequisite.
