Dragonmarks are arcane symbols marked on the skin seven of Khorvaire's common races. They are more intricate than a birthmark and more distinct than a tattoo. Dragonmarks are weaved of blue, green, and purple streaks so vivid, that they seem to glow even without producing light. Scholars still aren't sure as to the origins of Dragonmarks, yet their effect on the world is undeniable.

Of the thirteen true dragonmarks that once existed, twelve remain. As marks manifested on the peoples of Khorvaire, they did so exclusively in specific bloodlines. Each of these bloodlines has since joined with other of the same mark to form a house. With the power of their marks, these houses control large pieces of the economy of Khorvaire. Though each house is bound by the laws of the Korth Edict, in the wake of the last war these laws are being tested. If you bear a mark, it is up to you to decide how you relate to these powerful dragonmarked dynasties.
