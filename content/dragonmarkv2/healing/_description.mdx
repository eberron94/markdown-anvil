The Mark of Healing grants curative magical powers. The halflings of House Jorasco carry the Mark of Healing and operate the Healers Guild, which controls both the mundane and magical healing trades. A sick or injured person in Khorvaire is far more likely to seek healing from the Healers Guild than from any temple, and in fact most temples do not offer healing services for sale (though they still heal their own champions and faithful when necessary).
