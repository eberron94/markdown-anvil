**Cast** {two-action} dragonmark (least), somatic

**Duration** sustained up to 1 minute

While this spell is sustained, you gain the ability to see through solid objects to a range of 30 feet. Within that range, you have darkvision if you don't already have it. This special sight lasts for 1 minute. During that time, you perceive objects as ghostly, transparent images. The spell can see through most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, 3 feet of wood or dirt, or any magical material. You then become immune to {title} for 24 hours.

---

**Heightened (3rd)** You can see through twice the thickness of materials. Any amount of lead still blocks your vision.

**Heightened (7th)** The duration increases to 10 minutes.

---

**Greater Dragonmark** You do not need to sustain {title}.

**Grand Dragonmark** You become immune to {title} for only 1 hour after the spell ends.

**Siberys Dragonmark** You do not become immune to {title} after the spell ends.
