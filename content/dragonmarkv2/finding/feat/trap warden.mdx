You have an intuitive sense that alerts you to the dangers and presence of traps. You gain a circumstance bonus to Perception checks to find traps, to AC against attacks made by traps, and to saves against traps. Even if you aren't Searching, you get a check to find traps that normally require you to be Searching. You still need to meet any other requirements to find the trap.

You can disable traps that require a proficiency rank of master in Thievery. If you have master proficiency in Thievery, you can disable traps that require a proficiency rank of legendary instead.
