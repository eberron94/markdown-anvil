As a duraak'ash, you learn to let the Mark of Finding guide you. As you hone your hunting skills, your mark becomes a deeper part of you, helping you find and fight your prey. You gain the 2nd-level [Ranger Dedication](https://2e.aonprd.com/Archetypes.aspx?ID=9) feat, even if you normally couldn't take another dedication feat until you take more feats from your current archetype. You don't need to meet the feat's ability score prerequisite.
