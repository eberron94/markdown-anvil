All dragonmark focus spells are considered to be of the arcane tradition. When you gain a dragonmark focus pool, you may choose to use intelligence, wisdom, or charisma. This choice cannot be changed. 

Dragonmark focus spells follow all the rules for focus spells that appear on page 300 of the Core Rule book, including heightening, refocusing, and multiple point sources. Dragonmark focus spells don't require spell slots, and you can't cast them using spell slots. Certain feats can give you more dragonmark focus spells and increase the size of your focus pool, though your focus pool can never hold more than 3 focus points. It costs 1 focus point to cast a dragonmark focus spell. You refill your focus pool during your daily preparations, and you can regain 1 focus point by spending 10 minutes using the refocus activity to meditate on your dragonmark. Dragonmark focus spells are automatically heightened to half your level rounded up. You can't cast a focus spell if its minimum level is greater than the maximum heightened level of your dragonmark focus spells.

Many dragonmark focus spells require the dragonmark component. This component is supplied by the dragonmark itself, and so long as nothing is interfering with the dragonmark's powers, the component is automatically provided for the casting of the spell. When the dragonmark component is provided, it is evidently visible as the dragonmark glows with a dim light and shifts about on the caster's skin.
