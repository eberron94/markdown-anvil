The Mark of Storm grants the power to control weather, primarily through the manipulation of clouds, wind, and rain. A character with this mark can create a short, localized drizzle or a powerful rainstorm, a short breeze, or enough wind to propel a ship across the sea. The half-elves of House Lyrandar carry the Mark of Storm. Their Windwrights Guild dominates the business of shipping and transportation over both sea and sky. Their Raincallers Guild provides services to farmers across Khorvaire. Both guilds are found in every coastal nation of Khorvaire, and they proudly trace their ancestry to the elves of Aerenal and the humans of Thrane.
