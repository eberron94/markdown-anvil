**Cast** {two-action} dragonmark (least), somatic

Range 60 feet; **Area** 15-foot burst

**Duration** sustained up to 1 minute

You can condense the humidity in the air and bring down precipitation. Depending on the region and weather, this may bring down rain or snow. Every time you sustain this spell, you may move the area of effect 15 feet in a direction you choose. Creatures in the area of precipitation are concealed. Creatures outside the area are concealed from those inside the area. If you are in an extremely arid area, the spell fails. You may dismiss this spell.

When the spell finishes, the area under the cloud becomes difficult snowy terrain if it was snowing, or non-magical fires are extinguished if it was raining.
