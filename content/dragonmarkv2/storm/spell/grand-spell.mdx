**Cast** See replicated spell; dragonmark (grand), somatic

**Frequency** You can only cast this spell once per daily preparation - even if you have the focus points to cast it.

With a concentrated effort to bend the powers of your mark, you replicate the effects of a spell.

When you begin to cast {title}, you choose to replicate [Fly](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=125), [Control Weather](https://www.aonprd.com/SpellDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Control%20Weather), or [Lightning Storm](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=701). {title} gains the traits of the selected spell, then you may replicate the spell's effect by completing the Cast a Spell activity using the normal number of actions. The replicated spell is automatically heightened to the level of {title}.

You ignore any trivial material or verbal components of the replicated spell, but if the replicated spell requires a focus or material cost, you must still provide it to cast it.

**Siberys Dragonmark** You may cast {title} up to two times per daily preparation.
