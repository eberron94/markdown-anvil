Dragonmarked Houses have organized themselves around a hierarchical family structure because of the bloodlines that inherit the magical power of the house. Before the start of the game, you should determine what House you are a part of, even if you do not take the Least Dragonmark at 1st level. Houses have a great taboo about crossing the bloodlines of different dragonmarks since it has always produced an aberrant dragonmark.

## Unknown Bloodlines
If your character is not from a bloodline that manifests dragonmarks, there is still a chance to manifest one. The first, and most likely, reason is you are from a bloodline that branched off and did not produce a mark for several generations. A House keeps tabs on children born to one parent with dragonmarked ancestors since they have a chance to pass on the magic. But it is not guaranteed. After a several generations of not producing a mark in the branch, the House will stop tracking.

The other reason could be the dragonmark spontaneously manifesting. Most houses believe this to only be a fictional tale told to children who have no hope of producing a mark, but the half-elf houses know this can happen.
