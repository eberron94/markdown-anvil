You have learned how to manipulate your dragonmark to separate from your body to some degree. You spend 10 minutes focusing your marks magic, imprinting it with the potential of a bladed scarf, flail, meteor hammer, spiked chain, or whip. When you have a free hand, you can spend a single interact action to cause your dragonmark to separate from your body, forming the weapon in your free hand; a second interact action returns it to tattoo form. Your dragonmark weapon functions as the imprinted weapon and can be etched with runes or affixed with talismans as normal, which are suppressed when the weapon is in tattoo form. It also becomes an arcane focus.

You can only have one dragonmark weapon prepared at a time. If you prepare a second one, any runes on the previous weapon that are valid for the new weapon are transferred between them at no cost, but you lose any inapplicable runes.
