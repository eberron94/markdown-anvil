Despite the rigorous study of dragonmarks, it is not entirely understood how marks manifest.

Children are not born with their marks. Rather, a dragonmark most often appears in response to a stressful situation in which the powers of the mark could prove useful. A Deneith heir feels her dragonmark flare to life as her best friend would take a mortal wound. A Lyrandar scion instinctively dashes across the ropes of a stormtossed ship, and in an instant of burning pain, their mark appears. However, this is not exclusively the case. Sometimes marks will appear later in life, or even never manifest.

If a dragonmark does appear, often the mark will manifest first as the least mark. Through study and focus the bearer increases their power, and the dragonmark similarly increases in size and complexity. As their power grows, the marks channel not just stronger powers, but additional abilities.

There are stories of either long lost bloodlines suddenly manifesting a dragonmark after centuries of none. Rarer still are legends of those who have no connection to the bloodline manifesting a mark. In both cases, the houses will attempt to fold these individuals into the house's holdings. This brings them new blood and lets them keep an eye on those who's very existence represents the house.
