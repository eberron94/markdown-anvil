You may select from among the following focus spells when you gain the Dragonmark Adept feat. If the spell is from a different source, such as a class or archetype, it loses any associated traits and gains the Arcane, Dragonmark, and Mark of Hospitality traits. Note that rarity is maintained, and uncommon spells should be verified with your GM.
