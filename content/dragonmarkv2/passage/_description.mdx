The Mark of Passage bestows magical powers related to transportation and teleportation. The humans of House Orien are the bearers of the Mark of Passage. They control a worldwide Couriers Guild that uses its powers to carry parcels, messages, and people over great distances instantaneously for a high price. The house has holdings and operates across Khorvaire, though it traces its origins to Aundair. The house's Transportation Guild oversees lightning rail and caravan routes throughout central Khorvaire.
