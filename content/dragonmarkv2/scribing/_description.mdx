The Mark of Scribing grants powers related to writing and communication. Those who carry it specialize in the magic of the written word, serving as diplomats and translators or facilitating communication over long distances. The gnomes of House Sivis carry the Mark of Scribing. This house controls the Speakers Guild, which offers the services of translators and mediators and can facilitate instantaneous long-range communication by means of sending. In addition, House Sivis controls the Notaries Guild, which uses arcane mark to certify legal documents and similar work. This guild also prepares secure documents intended for specific recipients using illusory script and performs transcription and copying services. House Sivis originated in Zilargo and has spread along with the gnomes throughout the Five Nations. The house does not usually operate in regions where gnomes are rare.
