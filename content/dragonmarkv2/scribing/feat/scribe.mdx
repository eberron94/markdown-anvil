**Frequency** once per day

**Trigger** you fail a Decipher Writing, Learn a Spell, Craft a Scroll, or Create Forgery check.

Your training grants an eye and hand for scribing words, magical and mundane. If you roll a failure on a Decipher Writing, Learn a Spell, Create Forgery check, or Craft check to produce a Scroll, you can reroll the check. You may select the better of the two rolls.
