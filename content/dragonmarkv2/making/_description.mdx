The Mark of Making grants the power to mend or fabricate material goods. The humans of House Cannith carry the Mark of Making. Members of their Tinkers Guild often travel as widely as more traditional tinkers, stopping in villages to repair goods as they go. House Cannith also runs the Fabricators Guild, whose members include those with lesser or greater marks who can fabricate new items rather than just repair old ones.
