**Cast** 8 hours; dragonmark (greater), somatic

You begin to craft an item as if using the crafting activity, but with the empowering effects of your dragonmark guiding you, your efficiency is increased exponentially.

When you begin the Crafting activity, you can cast {title} as part of your activity. When you have spent a full day of the Crafting Activity under the effects of {title}, you may immediately make the crafting activity check to complete the item. On a critical success, you can finish the item, bypassing any remaining time to its completion as if you had completed the prerequisite days of work. Otherwise, you may continue on the item again the next day without any penalty. If you use {title} on your last day of work, you instead gain a +1 status bonus to the final crafting check. Once the item is completed, it follows the rules of the crafting activity to reduce cost which {title} may not assist with.

The materials and labor involved in assembling an item satisfy all of the required spell components and casting time of {title}.

**Siberys Dragonmark** The status bonus increases to +2.
