**Cast** {three-action} dragonmark (least), somatic

**Range** touch; **Targets** 1 object of light bulk or less

**Duration** until the next time you make your daily preparations

You draw upon your powers of warding to guard the presence of an item. Once the spell has been cast, you can choose to make the item come under the effects of Invisible Item. If the target is magical, you can choose to also have it appear as entirely non-magical.

If a caster uses detect magic or read aura of an equal or higher level than this spell, the GM can roll a secret counteract check for them to see the presence of this ward.

If a creature interacts with the item, you immediately become aware of this fact.

**Greater Dragonmark** The object is additionally warded as if it was behind running water and a thin sheet of lead to any magical effects that would attempt to locate it.
