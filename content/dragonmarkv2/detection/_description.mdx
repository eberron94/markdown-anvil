The Mark of Detection grants abilities that enable its possessor to discern the presence of threats, from poisoned food to scrying eyes. The half-elves of House Medani carry the Mark of Detection. One of the youngest of the dragonmarked houses, House Medani organized into a mercantile house as a result of the War of the Mark that ended fifteen hundred years ago. Despite the fact that it has stood as an established mercantile house for fifteen centuries, some of the older houses still view House Medani as an upstart. Unconcerned with the opinions of its peers, House Medani controls the Warning Guild, which offers services related to personal protection. House Medani originated in Breland and continues to concentrate its efforts in the central region of Khorvaire.
