When you replicate [Detect Scrying](https://2e.aonprd.com/Spells.aspx?ID=68) with Grand Detector, you detect the presence of all effects with the detection trait in the area. If Detect Scrying is higher level than a detection effect, you gain a glimpse of the detecting creature and learn its approximate distance and direction.
