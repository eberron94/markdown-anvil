As you undertake your training as a Medani prophet, you begin to receive powerful visions of the past and future. These visions often connect to your current location, such that you are far more likely to see an image of the ancient battles between quori and giant if you are in Xen'drik.

When you enter a new location, such as a room or corridor, you receive a vision related to one thing out of the ordinary. The GM determines what it is, or whether there's nothing reasonable to pick up, skipping obvious clues that can be easily noticed without a check or specifically looking for them. You learn only that an area or object is suspicious, but not why it's suspicious. For example, if you entered a study with a large bloodstain on the ground, the bloodstain is so obviously suspicious it's evident to you already, so the GM might note that there's something suspicious about the desk drawer instead. You would then need to investigate the drawer further to find out what specifically is out of the ordinary. Prophetic Visions doesn't reveal whether creatures are suspicious.

You don't typically get any benefit when you leave and come back to a place, though if a major change has happened there and time has passed, the GM might determine that you do.
