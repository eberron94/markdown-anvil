The Mark of Sentinel conveys powers that protect creatures from harm. The humans of House Deneith carry the Mark of Sentinel. They put their powers to use in the Defenders Guild, which offers comprehensive bodyguard services to persons of position and wealth. The house also provides sentinel marshals that have jurisdiction across national boundaries. House Deneith originated in Karrnath, but the Defenders Guild operates across Khorvaire.
