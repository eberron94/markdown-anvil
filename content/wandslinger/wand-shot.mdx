**Target** 1 creature

You channel your own energies through a wand, strengthening and focusing it just enough for an attack. Make a ranged attack roll versus the AC of the target.

**Critical Success** As success, but you deal double damage.

**Success** You deal 2d4 force damage. If the item level of the held wand is at least 12, the strike deals 3d4 force damage instead. If the item level of the held wand is at least 19, it deals 4d4 force damage instead.
