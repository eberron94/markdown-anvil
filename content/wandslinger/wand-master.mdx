You prepare the wand you wield, protecting it by channeling your own energies. For the next 10 minutes, when you Cast a Spell from the wand, you gain a status bonus to the DC 10 flat check to determine if wand is destroyed. The status bonus is equal to the number of Wandslinger feats you have divided by three rounded down.
