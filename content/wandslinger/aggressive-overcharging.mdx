You push your want to the absolute limit; you Cast a Spell from the wand you are wielding as if you just succeeded on the check from Trick Magic Item. The spell must have a Cast time of only one or two actions. A spell cast in this way is heightened to 1 spell level higher than normal, though this canâ€™t exceed spell level 10. The wand then breaks. A wand broken in this way cannot be repaired for 24 hours.
