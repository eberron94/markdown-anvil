You gain Trick Magic Item as a bonus feat and you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to skill checks to Trick wands. If you roll a Critical Failure to Trick a Magic Item that is a wand, you get a failure instead.

Upon taking this feat, choose one cantrip. It must come from a tradition in which you have the corresponding skill trained.

During your daily preparation, you can create a makeshift wand. This wand functions only for you and becomes inert at the start of your next daily preparations. Unlike most wands, your makeshift wand has an item level equal to your level, all the traits of the chosen cantrip, and the magical and wand traits.

**Special** You cannot select another dedication feat until you have gained two other feats from the Mark of Making archetype.
