During your daily preparation, you can make a second makeshift wand. This functions like a normal wand containing a 1st-level spell, which must be a common spell or another spell you learned via Learn a Spell, and it must come from a tradition in which you have the corresponding skill trained. This wand loses its magic the next time you make your daily preparations. Unlike a normal 1st-level spell wand, the item level of this wand is equal to your character level.
