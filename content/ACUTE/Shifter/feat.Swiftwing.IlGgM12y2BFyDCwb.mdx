You take no damage from falling, regardless of the distance you fall, as long as you are not incapacitated.

While you are shifted:

- Your arms grow leathery flaps of skin, similar to a bat. While not full flight, a strong flap allows you to jump further. When Leaping horizontally, you move an additional 5 feet (this additional distance isn't cumulative with the increased Leap distance from the Powerful Leap feat). You don't automatically fail your checks to High Jump or Long Jump if you don't Stride at least 10 feet first. In addition, when you attempt a Long Jump, you can jump a distance up to 10 feet longer than you normally would based on the result of your Athletics check, though you still can't jump farther than your Speed.
