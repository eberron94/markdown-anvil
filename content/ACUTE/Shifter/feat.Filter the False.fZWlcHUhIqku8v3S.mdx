You focus your mind to ignore falshoods around you, using your animal instinct as a guide. If the next action you use is to Shift, you gain the effects of a 2nd-level [True Seeing](https://2e.aonprd.com/Search.aspx?Query=True%20Seeing) spell, using your Perception modifier for the counteract check. The effect lasts as long as you are shifted.
