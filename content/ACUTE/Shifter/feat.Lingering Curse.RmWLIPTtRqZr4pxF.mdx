Shifter's have a natural resistance to curses, believed to be a result from the Lycanthrope curse creating them or from their connection to nature. You gain a +1 circumstance bonus to saving throws against curses, and to saving throws against spells cast by a daelkyr. If you roll a success on a saving throw against a curse or a spell cast by a daelkyr, you get a critical success instead.
